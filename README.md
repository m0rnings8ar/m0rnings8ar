# Ashutosh Jha

## 🚀 About Me  
Senior Software Engineer focused on **backend platforms, distributed systems, and ML-ready data pipelines**.  
Currently at **InfoEdge (99Acres)**, I build **real-time systems** that process millions of property, pricing, and user events daily to power search, pricing, and recommendation workflows for **500K+ users**.  

Previously at **Skuad (Payoneer)**, I worked on **Kafka-driven microservices and analytics platforms** that supported global payroll and compliance workflows at scale. I enjoy building systems where **data quality, reliability, and latency actually matter.**
